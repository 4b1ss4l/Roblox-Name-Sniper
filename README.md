# Roblox Username Checker

A Python script that generates random usernames and checks their availability on Roblox.

## Features

- Generates random usernames with configurable length
- Checks username availability through Roblox's API
- Categorizes results (available, taken, or censored)
- Logs all activities to a file
- Handles API errors with retry logic
- Color-coded console output
- Saves available usernames to `valid.txt`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  ```
  requests
  colorama
  ```

## Configuration

Edit the `CONFIG` dictionary in the script to change settings:

```python
CONFIG = {
    "USERNAME_LENGTH": 5,      # Length of generated usernames
    "DELAY": 0.5,             # Delay between checks (in seconds)
    "MAX_RETRIES": 3,         # Maximum retries on connection failure
    "RETRY_DELAY": 5,         # Delay between retries (in seconds)
    "API_TIMEOUT": 10         # API request timeout (in seconds)
}
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python username_checker.py
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Generate random usernames
   - Check each one against Roblox's API
   - Display color-coded results in the console
   - Save available usernames to `valid.txt`

3. To stop the script, press `Ctrl+C`

## Output Files

- `valid.txt`: Contains all available usernames found
- `username_checker.log`: Contains detailed logs of all operations

## Status Codes

The script recognizes these Roblox API response codes:
- `0`: Username is available (green)
- `1`: Username is already taken (gray)
- `2`: Username is censored/invalid (red)
- Other codes: Unknown status (yellow)

## Error Handling

The script includes:
- Automatic retries on connection failures
- Error logging with tracebacks
- Graceful handling of keyboard interrupts
- Recovery from unexpected errors

## Notes

- Roblox may rate limit or block excessive requests
- The script includes delays to be more API-friendly
- For legal use only - check Roblox's terms of service
